\label{ch:intro}

Outline:
- successes of Neural network models
- specifically for spacial related field (spatial transformer network, video thing)
- VizDoom and
- we propose
- potential usages of the proposed system: SLAM, loop closure detection
- analyses description

Space-time video completion \cite{Wexler2004}
Rationalizing Neural Prediction \cite{Lei2016}
Deep learning for visual understanding: A review \cite{Guo2016}
Spatial Transformer Networks \cite{Jaderberg2015}

Loop closure detection for visual SLAM systems using deep neural networks \cite{Gao2015}
Authors build a denoising autoencoder with sparse objective adding continuity objective.
Continuity objective enforces L2 similarity between extracted features for consecutive frames. They use dataset: freiburg2 slam.

Loop closure:
Loop Closure Detection for Visual SLAM Using PCANet Features.
Unsupervised learning to detect loops using deep neural networks for visual SLAM system.
VLAD-Based Loop Closure Detection For Monocular SLAM \cite{Xia2016, Gao2015a, Huang2016}
