\chapter{Discussion}
\label{ch:conc}

In this work we proposed a deep-learning technique for mapping sequences of visual data into a manifold space while preserving key spatial relations. We analyzed the effectiveness of our approach on tasks of varying complexity. Experiments showed, that model is capable to learn effectively some trivial trajectories and reveal some structure in more complex cases. Learned solutions typically reveal local spatial relation in the data and allow to identify self-intersecting trajectories. We showed, that even while working with exclusively visual data, out approach allows to create approximate prediction of the future position and possible visual frames.
