\chapter{Abstract}

\begin{english}

Localization problem is an important task in Artificial Intelligence (AI).
Extracting and maintaining high accuracy spatial information is crucial for most artificial actors, as automated robots, self-driving vehicles or AI characters in a computer game.
In this work we propose a method, for extracting spatial information from unlabeled continuous visual data using a regularized deep learning model.
We justify existence of a low-dimensional topological space in which actor's movements create a dense trajectory.
Then we propose a technique, that extracts a lower-dimensional encoding of visual data while simultaneously  tries to preserve spatial relations in the encoding space.
We analyze effectiveness of the proposed technique using data, collected with a 3D engine of a first-person shooter game \texttt{Doom II}.
